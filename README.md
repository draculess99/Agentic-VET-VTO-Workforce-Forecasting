## Overview

This project is an advanced agentic AI version of a warehouse workforce forecasting and VET/VTO labor planning application.

The system combines machine learning forecasting, rule-based operational logic, multi-agent reasoning, guardrails, and business-friendly AI explanations to support workforce planning decisions in a warehouse operations environment.

The original base project focused on forecasting workload and generating VET/VTO/Normal staffing signals. This advanced version extends that idea into an agentic AI decision-support system, where multiple agents analyze forecast results, interpret staffing risk, estimate labor cost impact, and produce executive-level explanations.

---

## Technology Stack

This project uses a multi-agent AI, machine learning, forecasting, and deployment stack.

**Core Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, Flask.

**AI / Agentic Stack:** Multi-Agent AI workflow, CrewAI-style agent structure, LangGraph-style node architecture, RAG-ready knowledge retrieval layer, guardrail-based recommendation logic, scenario validation, and AI-assisted decision explanations.

**Analytics / Forecasting:** Time series forecasting, recursive forecasting, feature engineering, baseline model comparison, forecast error analysis, cost impact estimation, and workforce staffing signal generation.

**Decision Support:** Forecast Agent, Staffing Decision Agent, Risk Assessment Agent, Cost Analysis Agent, RAG Agent, Executive Summary Agent, Memory Node, and Guardrail Node.

## Business Problem

Warehouse operations teams must often make staffing decisions under uncertainty.

Common labor planning challenges include:

* Unexpected demand spikes
* Overstaffing and unnecessary labor cost
* Understaffing and operational backlog risk
* Reactive VET/VTO decisions
* Limited explanation behind staffing recommendations
* Difficulty translating forecast output into business action

This project addresses those challenges by using AI-assisted forecasting and agentic reasoning to support more informed staffing decisions.

---

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning and agentic AI can be combined to support warehouse labor planning.

The system is designed to:

* Forecast future workload
* Generate VET, VTO, or Normal staffing recommendations
* Apply operational guardrails
* Estimate labor cost impact
* Explain staffing decisions in business language
* Provide an AI-assisted decision-support layer for operations leaders

This screenshot shows the advanced weekly scenario mode, where operational drivers such as demand velocity, shipping delay, congestion, logistics stress, labor cost, and economic variables are used to generate forecast output, VET/VTO staffing signals, estimated labor cost impact, confidence scoring, and primary risk-driver identification.

### 2. AI Operational Decision Summary

![AI Operational Decision Summary](images/ai-operational-decision-summary.png)

This screenshot shows the application generating a business-facing operational summary using forecast output, staffing logic, risk assessment, estimated labor cost impact, RAG context, and operational memory.

### 3. Node Workflow State Trace

![Node Workflow State Trace](images/node-workflow-state-trace.png)

This screenshot shows the node workflow state trace used to inspect how the application passes operational data through the forecasting pipeline. It displays the current forecast state, forecast node output, staffing node output, cost node output, and intermediate decision fields such as peak week, stress band, confidence score, primary risk driver, VET weeks, and VTO weeks.

### 4. RAG Context Node Output

![RAG Context Node Output](images/rag-context-node-output.png)

This screenshot shows the RAG Context Node retrieving operational reference material, scenario signals, cost assumptions, VET/VTO policy notes, forecasting methodology, and project limitations to support the final AI operational decision summary.

### 5. Guardrail Validation Example

![Guardrail Validation Example](images/input-guardrail-validation.png)

The application rejects unrealistic scenario inputs before running the forecast, demonstrating that the system includes validation checks before allowing forecast execution.

---

## Model and Data

The forecasting layer uses historical workload and demand-related data to generate future workload estimates.

The project includes:

- Historical training data
- Store and feature data
- Saved model artifact
- Scenario templates for stress testing
- Cost and staffing assumptions

The saved model is stored in the `models/` directory and is used by the application to generate forecast-driven labor planning recommendations.

---

## Agentic AI Architecture

This project uses a multi-agent structure inspired by CrewAI and LangGraph-style workflow orchestration.

The agentic layer separates the decision process into specialized roles:

### Forecast Agent

Analyzes workload forecasts and identifies future demand patterns.

### Staffing Agent

Interprets forecast output and converts it into staffing recommendations such as VET, VTO, or Normal staffing.

### Cost Agent

Evaluates labor cost impact using regular labor cost, overtime cost, and staffing assumptions.

### Executive Agent

Summarizes the forecast, staffing recommendation, risk level, and business impact in plain English.

### Guardrail Layer

Checks whether staffing recommendations are operationally reasonable and avoids unrealistic or unsafe recommendations.

---

## Example Use Case

A warehouse operations manager wants to know whether the upcoming workload requires additional labor coverage.

The system can:

1. Forecast expected workload
2. Identify peak demand periods
3. Recommend whether VET, VTO, or Normal staffing is appropriate
4. Estimate labor cost impact
5. Explain the recommendation in business language
6. Apply guardrails to avoid unsafe or unrealistic staffing decisions

---

## Guardrails

The guardrail layer is designed to ensure the system does not blindly produce staffing recommendations without operational checks.

Examples of guardrail logic include:

* Avoiding aggressive VTO recommendations during high-demand weeks
* Flagging peak demand periods
* Identifying potential staffing risk
* Preventing unrealistic labor planning assumptions
* Reminding users that AI output is decision support, not a replacement for human judgment

---

## Limitations

This project is a prototype and is not intended for production workforce scheduling without further validation.

Current limitations include:

- Forecast results depend on available historical data
- Staffing recommendations are simplified for portfolio demonstration purposes
- Labor rules and site-specific workforce policies are not fully modeled
- RAG documents are structured as local operational context rather than a production vector database
- Human review is required before applying any staffing recommendation

---

## AI Decision-Support Disclaimer

This application is a decision-support prototype.

It does not replace human operations judgment, workforce management policies, labor rules, or business leadership review. The AI-generated recommendations should be interpreted as planning support and reviewed by qualified operations personnel before use in real staffing decisions.

---

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how traditional forecasting applications can evolve into AI-assisted operational decision systems.

Instead of only showing a forecast chart, the system attempts to answer the more useful business question:

This project demonstrates how warehouse workload forecasting can be extended into an agentic AI system that reasons about staffing decisions, cost impact, operational risk, and executive communication.

> “What should operations do with this forecast?”

By combining forecasting, agents, guardrails, and executive summaries, this project shows how AI can help translate predictive analytics into practical workforce planning decisions.

---

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

* Add live database integration
* Add stronger backtesting dashboards
* Add model comparison between XGBoost, baseline, and time-series models
* Add richer RAG retrieval from operational policy documents
* Add user authentication
* Add cloud deployment
* Add automated monitoring
* Add hospital staffing or healthcare workforce forecasting extension
* Add improved explainability with SHAP or feature importance
* Add scenario comparison across multiple labor planning strategies
